# TNAPF - Totally Not Another PHP Framework

TNAPF (Totally Not Another PHP Framework) is an open-source organization dedicated to providing dynamic and easy-to-use PHP packages that can be utilized in any setting. Our goal is to simplify PHP development by offering a collection of independent packages with clear separation, allowing developers to pick and choose the components they need without the complexity of a monolithic framework.

## Key Features and Advantages

- **Flexible Package Selection**: TNAPF offers a variety of packages that can be used independently, giving developers the freedom to select and integrate only the components they require for their projects.
- **Wide Usability**: Our packages are designed to work seamlessly in any PHP project, offering a universal solution for different use cases.
- **Minimal External Dependencies**: We strive to minimize external dependencies in our packages, ensuring a lightweight and efficient development experience. However, some packages may include interfaces following PSR standards.
- **Active Maintenance and Bug Fixes**: TNAPF is actively maintained by the core contributors, and we prioritize resolving bugs and issuing bug fixes promptly.
- **Community-Driven Development**: We welcome contributions from the community. Developers can open pull requests to improve existing packages or suggest new packages. Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TgrcSkuDtQ) to connect with other contributors and discuss ideas.
